# Jobify
Our program aims to solve the declining job levels after the COVID-19 pandemic by creating a connection between employees and employers.

In the hackathon folder, there are 19 files. There are a total 3 text files. The accountant and lawyer are the text file for the job class 
and the database text file is self-explanatory; it is for the database class. These text files would be accessed and changed by the BufferedReader
and BufferdWriter method. Other than the text files, there are the java files, the most important one is the JobifyRunner. This is the most important
one as it will run through all the functions of the software.
